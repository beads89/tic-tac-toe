We'll need two players.

We'll need to switch turns.
  How do we switch - turn = 0 to turn =1

We'll need to make the game rules

Create 3x3 board (3 rows, 3 columns)
  Make 1 box and make 1 box clickable
  	Then 1 row, build from there
  Each space to be clickable
  on click put X or O
  

Create a construct/prototype for board, game, space(position on board sq1, sq2 etc.) and players.

Create win condition

Describe: turnToggle
Test: "It should switch between player 1 and player 2"
Code: $("button).click(funciton() {
